For-Loop :
1 - An arrayâ€™s length should be cached to save gas in for-loops
Reading array length at each iteration of the loop takes 6 gas

2 - Increments can be unchecked and ++i costs less gas compared to i++

3  Use != 0 instead of > 0 at the above mentioned codes. The variable is uint, so it will not be below 0 so it can just check != 0.
!= 0 costs less gas compared to > 0 for unsigned integers in require statements with the optimizer enabled

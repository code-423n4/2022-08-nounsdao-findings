1.	`MAX_QUORUM_VOTES_BPS` constant is not used in the code. It should be removed.

2.	There is no need of struct `ProposalTemp`. It is used only in the propose method. Use params in the method instead of struct and save gas, that you donâ€™t need to store struct to the memory and only use params from stack.

3.	Revert when there is no such proposal instead of returning zero values.
Add check like `require(proposalCount >= proposalId, 'NounsDAO::state: invalid proposal id');`

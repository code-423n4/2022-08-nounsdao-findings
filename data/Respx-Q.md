# Summary
This code is very well presented in my opinion, with good comments. There are some functions without comments (see below) and it could be improved by more comments within the functions explaining the code.

NounsDAOLogicV1 line 94: The constant `proposalMaxOperations` should be in all caps like the other constants or, if there is a good reason for it not to be, that reason should be given in a comment.

NounsDAOLogicV2 line 92 The constant `proposalMaxOperations` should be in ALL CAPS like the other constants or, if there is a good reason for it not to be, that reason should be explained in a comment.

NounsDAOLogicV1 line 46: comment typo: "veteor" should be "vetoer".

`NounsDAOLogicV1.cancel()` can be called on any proposal that is not executed. That means it is possible to call it on proposals that have a status which is already concluded: *Defeated, Expired, Vetoed* (assuming that `timelock.cancelTransaction()` calls [this function](https://github.com/compound-finance/compound-protocol/blob/b9b14038612d846b83f8a009a82c38974ff2dcfe/contracts/Timelock.sol#L71), it will not revert, and so the status change will succeed).
For *Defeated* or *Expired*, it will update the reported status of the propsal, misrepresenting the reason the proposal was not executed and possibly disrupting data and reporting tools.

Comment on line 86 of `NounsDAOLogicV2` is wrong: 6,000 basis points, not 4,000.

The above linked functions are all missing comment headers to explain their purpose and give any other pertinent details.

I would add a comment explaining why the contract needs to be payable now.

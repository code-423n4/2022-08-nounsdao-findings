``` Check caller is pendingAdmin and pendingAdmin â‰  address(0) ```
Should be check that `msg.sender` is the vetoer 

## REDUNDANT CHECK USING REQUIRE
There is check for `msg.sender == vetoer` in `_burnVetoPower()` and `_setVetoer`. And `_burnVetoPower()` is calling the `_setVeoter()`, so there will be double check for `msg.sender`

## NO CHECK BOOL FOR USING LOW CALL FUNCTION IN `_withdraw()` 

The function signature has a boolean return value and they indicate errors that way instead. By not checking the return value, operations that should have marked as failed, may potentially go through without actually making a payment.

## Variables shouldn't be initialized as 0 or false as they have these values by default

## More efficient struct packing

```
struct ProposalCondensed {
        /// @notice Unique id for looking up a proposal
        uint256 id;
        /// @notice Creator of the proposal
        address proposer;
       /// @notice Flag marking whether the proposal has been canceled
        bool canceled;
        /// @notice Flag marking whether the proposal has been vetoed
        bool vetoed;
        /// @notice Flag marking whether the proposal has been executed
        bool executed;
        /// @notice The number of votes needed to create a proposal at the time of proposal creation. *DIFFERS from GovernerBravo
        uint256 proposalThreshold;
        /// @notice The minimum number of votes in support of a proposal required in order for a quorum to be reached and for a vote to succeed at the time of proposal creation. *DIFFERS from GovernerBravo
        uint256 quorumVotes;
        /// @notice The timestamp that the proposal will be available for execution, set once the vote succeeds
        uint256 eta;
        /// @notice The block at which voting begins: holders must delegate their votes prior to this block
        uint256 startBlock;
        /// @notice The block at which voting ends: votes must be cast prior to this block
        uint256 endBlock;
        /// @notice Current number of votes in favor of this proposal
        uint256 forVotes;
        /// @notice Current number of votes in opposition to this proposal
        uint256 againstVotes;
        /// @notice Current number of votes for abstaining for this proposal
        uint256 abstainVotes;
        /// @notice The total supply at the time of proposal creation
        uint256 totalSupply;
        /// @notice The block at which this proposal was created
        uint256 creationBlock;
    }
```

## `require()` statements with `&&` conditionals should be divided into two different `require()` statements

## `require()` statements can decrease their revert message to less than 32 characters in order to save gas

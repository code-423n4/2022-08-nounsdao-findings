# Overview

## About C4

Code4rena (C4) is an open organization consisting of security researchers, auditors, developers, and individuals with domain expertise in smart contracts.

A C4 audit contest is an event in which community participants, referred to as Wardens, review, audit, or analyze smart contract logic in exchange for a bounty provided by sponsoring projects.

During the audit contest outlined in this document, C4 conducted an analysis of the Nouns DAO smart contract system written in Solidity. The audit contest took place between August 22â€”August 27 2022.

This contest was judged by [gzeon](https://twitter.com/gzeon).

Final report assembled by [itsmetechjay](https://twitter.com/itsmetechjay).

# Summary

The C4 analysis yielded an aggregated total of 4 unique vulnerabilities. Of these vulnerabilities, 1 received a risk rating in the category of HIGH severity and 3 received a risk rating in the category of MEDIUM severity.

Additionally, C4 analysis included 116 reports detailing issues with a risk rating of LOW severity or non-critical. There were also 126 reports recommending gas optimizations.

All of the issues presented here are linked back to their original finding.

# Scope

The code under review can be found within the [C4 Nouns DAO contest repository](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-nounsdao), and is composed of 6 smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language and includes 2,412 lines of Solidity code.

# Severity Criteria

C4 assesses the severity of disclosed vulnerabilities according to a methodology based on [OWASP standards](https://owasp.org/www-community/OWASP_Risk_Rating_Methodology).

Vulnerabilities are divided into three primary risk categories: high, medium, and low/non-critical.

High-level considerations for vulnerabilities span the following key areas when conducting assessments:

- Malicious Input Handling
- Escalation of privileges
- Arithmetic
- Gas use

Further information regarding the severity criteria referenced throughout the submission review process, please refer to the documentation provided on [the C4 website](https://code4rena.com).

# High Risk Findings (1)
## [[H-01] ERC721Checkpointable: delegateBySig allows the user to vote to address 0, which causes the user to permanently lose his vote and cannot transfer his NFT.](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-nounsdao-findings/issues/157)
_Submitted by cccz, also found by berndartmueller, bin2chen, csanuragjain, IEatBabyCarrots, jayphbee, KIntern&#95;NA, Lambda, and zzzitron_

In the ERC721Checkpointable contract, when the user votes with the delegate function, the delegatee will not be address 0.

        function delegate(address delegatee) public {
            if (delegatee == address(0)) delegatee = msg.sender;
            return _delegate(msg.sender, delegatee);
        }

However, there is no such restriction in the delegateBySig function, which allows the user to vote to address 0.

        function delegateBySig(
            address delegatee,
            uint256 nonce,
            uint256 expiry,
            uint8 v,
            bytes32 r,
            bytes32 s
        ) public {
            bytes32 domainSeparator = keccak256(
                abi.encode(DOMAIN_TYPEHASH, keccak256(bytes(name())), getChainId(), address(this))
            );
            bytes32 structHash = keccak256(abi.encode(DELEGATION_TYPEHASH, delegatee, nonce, expiry));
            bytes32 digest = keccak256(abi.encodePacked('\x19\x01', domainSeparator, structHash));
            address signatory = ecrecover(digest, v, r, s);
            require(signatory != address(0), 'ERC721Checkpointable::delegateBySig: invalid signature');
            require(nonce == nonces[signatory]++, 'ERC721Checkpointable::delegateBySig: invalid nonce');
            require(block.timestamp <= expiry, 'ERC721Checkpointable::delegateBySig: signature expired');
            return _delegate(signatory, delegatee);
        }

If user A votes to address 0 in the delegateBySig function, \_delegates\[A] will be address 0, but the delegates function will return the address of user A and getCurrentVotes(A) will return 0.

        function _delegate(address delegator, address delegatee) internal {
            /// @notice differs from `_delegate()` in `Comp.sol` to use `delegates` override method to simulate auto-delegation
            address currentDelegate = delegates(delegator);

            _delegates[delegator] = delegatee;
    ...
        function delegates(address delegator) public view returns (address) {
            address current = _delegates[delegator];
            return current == address(0) ? delegator : current;
        }

Later, if user A votes to another address or transfers NFT, the \_moveDelegates function will fail due to overflow, which makes user A lose votes forever and cannot transfer NFT.

        function _moveDelegates(
            address srcRep,
            address dstRep,
            uint96 amount
        ) internal {
            if (srcRep != dstRep && amount > 0) {
                if (srcRep != address(0)) {
                    uint32 srcRepNum = numCheckpoints[srcRep];
                    uint96 srcRepOld = srcRepNum > 0 ? checkpoints[srcRep][srcRepNum - 1].votes : 0;
                    uint96 srcRepNew = sub96(srcRepOld, amount, 'ERC721Checkpointable::_moveDelegates: amount underflows'); // auditor : overflow here
                    _writeCheckpoint(srcRep, srcRepNum, srcRepOld, srcRepNew);
                }

On the other hand, since the burn function also fails, this can also be used to prevent the NFT from being burned by the minter

        function burn(uint256 nounId) public override onlyMinter {
            _burn(nounId);
            emit NounBurned(nounId);
        }
    ...
        function _burn(uint256 tokenId) internal virtual {
            address owner = ERC721.ownerOf(tokenId);

            _beforeTokenTransfer(owner, address(0), tokenId);
    ...
        function _beforeTokenTransfer(
            address from,
            address to,
            uint256 tokenId
        ) internal override {
            super._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, tokenId);

            /// @notice Differs from `_transferTokens()` to use `delegates` override method to simulate auto-delegation
            _moveDelegates(delegates(from), delegates(to), 1);
        }

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider requiring in the `delegateBySig` function that delegatee cannot be address 0.

```diff
    function delegateBySig(
        address delegatee,
        uint256 nonce,
        uint256 expiry,
        uint8 v,
        bytes32 r,
        bytes32 s
    ) public {
+ require(delegatee != address(0));
```

# Medium Risk Findings (3)
## [[M-01] Voters can burn large amounts of Ether by submitting votes with long reason strings](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-nounsdao-findings/issues/174)
_Submitted by Respx_

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-nounsdao/blob/45411325ec14c6d747b999a40367d3c5109b5a89/contracts/governance/NounsDAOLogicV2.sol#L518-L524>

### Vulnerability Details

Voters can burn large amounts of Ether by submitting votes with long reason strings

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-nounsdao/blob/45411325ec14c6d747b999a40367d3c5109b5a89/contracts/governance/NounsDAOLogicV2.sol#L518-L524>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-nounsdao/blob/45411325ec14c6d747b999a40367d3c5109b5a89/contracts/governance/NounsDAOLogicV2.sol#L533-L544>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-nounsdao/blob/45411325ec14c6d747b999a40367d3c5109b5a89/contracts/governance/NounsDAOLogicV2.sol#L98>

The only limits to how long a string argument to a function call can be is the block gas limit of the EVM, currently 30 million. It is therefore possible for a user to call `NounsDAOLogicV2.castRefundableVoteWithReason()` with a very, very long `reason` string. `castRefundableVoteInternal()` emits an event that includes `reason` on line 540, which is within the region of code covered by gas refunds (gas refunds are measured from `startGas` on line 538). Because of this, gas refunds will include the gas price of emitting this event, which could potentially be very large.

### Impact

This issue is partially mitigated by the fact that the voter will still bear the cost of the massive calldata usage. `NounsDAOLogicV2` covers this with a fixed value of `REFUND_BASE_GAS` (36000), but the real transaction overhead is far larger when submitting a `reason` string that is many thousands of characters in length. Therefore, the voter ends up losing roughly as much as is drained from the `NounsDAOLogicV2` contract by the refund.
Nonetheless, I still think this is a valid high funding as the protocol will not want to rely purely on this economic protection. Some risk scenarios:

1.  It is quite possible that calldata prices could decrease in future, perhaps as part of catering for rollups. This could make the attack suddenly far more viable.
2.  A voter might have some motive to want to emit some arbitrary text as an Ethereum event, and simply exploit this system to do so.
3.  A voter might want to maliciously drain the Ether, perhaps to damage the protocol's reputation.
4.  As in 3, this could be achieved by emptying out the last funds in \`\`NounsDAOLogicV2\` and so denying many other voters their voting refunds.

### Tools Used

Hardhat testing

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

2 alternative ideas:

1.  Move the `emit VoteCast` outside of the gas calculation region of the code and increase `REFUND_BASE_GAS` to cover an event with a reasonable length of string.
2.  Change the type of `reason` to `bytes` and add a check to its length in `castRefundableVoteWithReason()`, reverting if it is too long.

### Proof of Concept

The single vote in this test burns around 0.25 Ether from the `NounsDAOLogicV2` contract.
This test runs slowly and is assuming a base fee of 500 gwei. Obviously if the base fee were higher, the gas burnt would also be higher.
The numbers are printed out with a rather messy `console.log()` in the middle of the test output. Apologies for the bad presentation, but on the bright side you can adjust the numbers and see different results.

## [[M-02] User A cannot cancel User B's proposal when User B's prior number of votes at relevant block is same as proposal threshold, which contradicts the fact that User B actually cannot create the proposal when the prior number of votes is same as proposal threshold](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-nounsdao-findings/issues/255)

### Impact

When User B calls the following `propose` function for creating a proposal, it checks that User B's prior number of votes at the relevant block is larger than the proposal threshold through executing `nouns.getPriorVotes(msg.sender, block.number - 1) > temp.proposalThreshold`. This means that User B cannot create the proposal when the prior number of votes and the proposal threshold are the same.

After User B's proposal is created, User A can call the following `cancel` function to cancel it. When calling `cancel`, it checks that User B's prior number of votes at the relevant block is less than the proposal threshold through executing `nouns.getPriorVotes(proposal.proposer, block.number - 1) < proposal.proposalThreshold`. When User B's prior number of votes and the proposal threshold are the same, User A cannot cancel this proposal of User B. However, this contradicts the fact User B actually cannot create this proposal when the same condition holds true. In other words, if User B cannot create this proposal when the prior number of votes and the proposal threshold are the same, User A should be able to cancel User B's proposal under the same condition but it is not true. The functionality for canceling User B's proposal in this situation becomes unavailable for User A.

                nouns.getPriorVotes(proposal.proposer, block.number - 1) < proposal.proposalThreshold,
            'NounsDAO::cancel: proposer above threshold'
        );

### Proof of Concept

Please append the following test in the `NounsDAOV2#inflationHandling` `describe` block in `test\governance\NounsDAO\V2\inflationHandling.test.ts`. This test should pass to demonstrate the described scenario.

```typescript
  it("User A cannot cancel User B's proposal when User B's prior number of votes at relevant block is same as proposal threshold, which contradicts the fact that User B actually cannot create the proposal when the prior number of votes is same as proposal threshold",
    async () => {
    // account1 has 3 tokens at the beginning
    // account1 gains 2 more to own 5 tokens in total
    await token.transferFrom(deployer.address, account1.address, 11);
    await token.transferFrom(deployer.address, account1.address, 12);

    await mineBlock();

    // account1 cannot create a proposal when owning 5 tokens in total
    await expect(
      gov.connect(account1).propose(targets, values, signatures, callDatas, 'do nothing'),
    ).to.be.revertedWith('NounsDAO::propose: proposer votes below proposal threshold');

    // account1 gains 1 more to own 6 tokens in total
    await token.transferFrom(deployer.address, account1.address, 13);

    await mineBlock();

    // account1 can create a proposal when owning 6 tokens in total
    await gov.connect(account1).propose(targets, values, signatures, callDatas, 'do nothing');
    const proposalId = await gov.latestProposalIds(account1.address);
    expect(await gov.state(proposalId)).to.equal(0);

    // other user cannot cancel account1's proposal at this moment
    await expect(
      gov.cancel(proposalId, {gasLimit: 1e6})
    ).to.be.revertedWith('NounsDAO::cancel: proposer above threshold');
    
    // account1 removes 1 token to own 5 tokens in total
    await token.connect(account1).transferFrom(account1.address, deployer.address, 13);

    await mineBlock();

    // other user still cannot cancel account1's proposal when account1 owns 5 tokens in total
    // this contradicts the fact that account1 cannot create a proposal when owning 5 tokens in total
    await expect(
      gov.cancel(proposalId, {gasLimit: 1e6})
    ).to.be.revertedWith('NounsDAO::cancel: proposer above threshold');

    // account1 removes another token to own 4 tokens in total
    await token.connect(account1).transferFrom(account1.address, deployer.address, 12);

    await mineBlock();

    // other user can now cancel account1's proposal when account1 owns 4 tokens in total
    await gov.cancel(proposalId, {gasLimit: 1e6})
    expect(await gov.state(proposalId)).to.equal(2);
  });
```

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-nounsdao/blob/main/contracts/governance/NounsDAOLogicV2.sol#L197-L200> can be changed to the following code.

```solidity
        require(
            nouns.getPriorVotes(msg.sender, block.number - 1) >= temp.proposalThreshold,
            'NounsDAO::propose: proposer votes below proposal threshold'
        );
```

or

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-nounsdao/blob/main/contracts/governance/NounsDAOLogicV2.sol#L350-L354> can be changed to the following code.

```solidity
        require(
            msg.sender == proposal.proposer ||
                nouns.getPriorVotes(proposal.proposer, block.number - 1) <= proposal.proposalThreshold,
            'NounsDAO::cancel: proposer above threshold'
        );
```

but not both.

 > We agree that the case of prior votes equal to `proposalThreshold` is missed, and plan to include that state in what is cancelable.

### Impact

The veto power is import functionality for current NounsDAO in order to protect their treasury from malicious proposals.
However there is lack of zero address check and lack of 2 step address changing process for vetoer address.
This might lead to Nounders losing their veto power unintentionally and open to 51% attack which can drain their entire treasury.

Refrence from Nouns DAO contest documents:
<https://dialectic.ch/editorial/nouns-governance-attack>
<https://dialectic.ch/editorial/nouns-governance-attack-2>

### Proof of Concept

Lack of 0-address check for vetoer address at `initialize()` and `\_setVetoer()` of NounsDAOLogicV2.sol and NounsDAOLogicV1.sol.
Also it is better to make changing address process of vetoer at `\_setVetoer()` into 2-step process to avoid accidently setting
vetoer to zero address or any other arbitrary addresses and end up burning/losing veto power unintentionally.

1.  Vetoer address of `initialize()` of NounsDAOLogicV2.sol, NounsDAOLogicV1.sol

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-nounsdao/blob/45411325ec14c6d747b999a40367d3c5109b5a89/contracts/governance/NounsDAOLogicV2.sol#L156>

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-nounsdao/blob/45411325ec14c6d747b999a40367d3c5109b5a89/contracts/governance/NounsDAOLogicV1.sol#L150>

2.  Vetoer address of `\_setVetoer()` of NounsDAOLogicV2.sol, NounsDAOLogicV1.sol

<https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-nounsdao/blob/45411325ec14c6d747b999a40367d3c5109b5a89/contracts/governance/NounsDAOLogicV2.sol#L839-L845>

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

Add zero address check for vetoer address at `initialize()`.
Also change `\_setVetoer()` vetoer address changing process to 2-step process like explained below.

First make the `\_setVetoer()` function approve a new vetoer address as a pending vetoer.
Next that pending vetoer has to claim the ownership in a separate transaction to be a new vetoer.

## [L&#x2011;01]  Nouns will not be able to be transferred once the `block.number` passes `type(uint32).max`
While this currently equates to ~1260 years, if there's a hard fork which makes block times much more frequent (e.g. to compete with Solana), then this limit may be reached much faster than expected, and transfers and delegations will remain stuck at their existing settings

*There are 2 instances of this issue:*

## [L&#x2011;02]  Unused/empty `receive()`/`fallback()` function
If the intention is for the Ether to be used, the function should call another function, otherwise it should revert (e.g. `require(msg.sender == address(weth))`). Having no access control on the function means that someone may send Ether to the contract, and have no way to get anything back out, which is a loss of funds

## [N&#x2011;01]  `public` functions not called by the contract should be declared `external` instead
Contracts [are allowed](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/contracts.html#function-overriding) to override their parents' functions and change the visibility from `external` to `public`.

## [N&#x2011;02]  Non-assembly method available 
`assembly{ id := chainid() }` => `uint256 id = block.chainid`, `assembly { size := extcodesize() }` => `uint256 size = address().code.length`
There are some automated tools that will flag a project as having higher complexity if there is inline-assembly, so it's best to avoid using it where it's not necessary

## [N&#x2011;03]  `2**<n> - 1` should be re-written as `type(uint<n>).max`
Earlier versions of solidity can use `uint<n>(-1)` instead. Expressions not including the `- 1` can often be re-written to accomodate the change (e.g. by using a `>` rather than a `>=`, which will also save some gas)

## [N&#x2011;06]  Expressions for constant values such as a call to `keccak256()`, should use `immutable` rather than `constant`
While it doesn't save any gas because the compiler knows that developers often make this mistake, it's still best to use the right tool for the task at hand. There is a difference between `constant` variables and `immutable` variables, and they should each be used in their appropriate contexts. `constants` should be used for literal values written into the code, and `immutable` variables should be used for expressions, or values calculated in, or passed into the constructor.

## [N&#x2011;07]  Constant redefined elsewhere
Consider defining in only one contract so that values cannot become out of sync when only one location is updated. A [cheap way](https://medium.com/coinmonks/gas-cost-of-solidity-library-functions-dbe0cedd4678) to store constants in a single location is to create an `internal constant` in a `library`. If the variable is a local cache of another contract's value, consider making the cache variable internal or private, which will require external users to query the contract with the source of truth, so that callers don't get out of sync.

Usually lines in source code are limited to [80](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/148677/why-is-80-characters-the-standard-limit-for-code-width) characters. Today's screens are much larger so it's reasonable to stretch this in some cases. Since the files will most likely reside in GitHub, and GitHub starts using a scroll bar in all cases when the length is over [164](https://github.com/aizatto/character-length) characters, the lines below should be split when they reach that length

## [N&#x2011;10]  Event is missing `indexed` fields
Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each `event` should use three `indexed` fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

Total: 313 instances over 23 issues

## [G&#x2011;01]  State checks unnecessarily re-fetch `Proposal`s
Every call to `state()` fetches the `Proposal` storage variable, which is fetched again immediately afterwards by the caller. If instead there were a version of `state()` that took in a `Proposal storage` variable, the proposal could be fetched only once, saving the gas of the mapping lookup

*There are 5 instances of this issue. (For in-depth details on this and all further gas optimizations with multiple instances, please see the warden's [full report](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-nounsdao-findings/issues/164).)*

## [G&#x2011;02]  Multiple `address`/ID mappings can be combined into a single `mapping` of an `address`/ID to a `struct`, where appropriate
Saves a storage slot for the mapping. Depending on the circumstances and sizes of types, can avoid a Gsset (**20000 gas**) per mapping combined. Reads and subsequent writes can also be cheaper when a function requires both values and they both fit in the same storage slot. Finally, if both fields are accessed in the same function, can save **~42 gas per access** due to [not having to recalculate the key's keccak256 hash](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ec23a57daa30a8f8ca8b9681c8ccefb0) (Gkeccak256 - 30 gas) and that calculation's associated stack operations.

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/base/ERC721Checkpointable.sol

53        mapping(address => mapping(uint32 => Checkpoint)) public checkpoints;
54    
55        /// @notice The number of checkpoints for each account
56:       mapping(address => uint32) public numCheckpoints;

```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-nounsdao/blob/45411325ec14c6d747b999a40367d3c5109b5a89/contracts/base/ERC721Checkpointable.sol#L53-L56

## [G&#x2011;03]  Structs can be packed into fewer storage slots
Each slot saved can avoid an extra Gsset (**20000 gas**) for the first setting of the struct. Subsequent reads as well as writes have smaller gas savings

*There are 3 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;04]  Using `calldata` instead of `memory` for read-only arguments in `external` functions saves gas
When a function with a `memory` array is called externally, the `abi.decode()` step has to use a for-loop to copy each index of the `calldata` to the `memory` index. **Each iteration of this for-loop costs at least 60 gas** (i.e. `60 * <mem_array>.length`). Using `calldata` directly, obliviates the need for such a loop in the contract code and runtime execution. Note that even if an interface defines a function as having `memory` arguments, it's still valid for implementation contracs to use `calldata` arguments instead. 

If the array is passed to an `internal` function which passes the array to another internal function where the array is modified and therefore `memory` is used in the `external` call, it's still more gass-efficient to use `calldata` when the `external` function uses modifiers, since the modifiers may prevent the internal functions from being called. Structs have the same overhead as an array of length one

Note that I've also flagged instances where the function is `public` but can be marked as `external` since it's not called by the contract, and cases where a constructor is involved

*There are 10 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;05]  Using `storage` instead of `memory` for structs/arrays saves gas
When fetching data from a storage location, assigning the data to a `memory` variable causes all fields of the struct/array to be read from storage, which incurs a Gcoldsload (**2100 gas**) for *each* field of the struct/array. If the fields are read from the new memory variable, they incur an additional `MLOAD` rather than a cheap stack read. Instead of declearing the variable with the `memory` keyword, declaring the variable with the `storage` keyword and caching any fields that need to be re-read in stack variables, will be much cheaper, only incuring the Gcoldsload for the fields actually read. The only time it makes sense to read the whole struct/array into a `memory` variable, is if the full struct/array is being returned by the function, is being passed to a function that requires `memory`, or if the array/struct is being read from another `memory` array/struct

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/governance/NounsDAOLogicV2.sol

952:              DynamicQuorumParamsCheckpoint memory cp = quorumParamsCheckpoints[center];

```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-nounsdao/blob/45411325ec14c6d747b999a40367d3c5109b5a89/contracts/governance/NounsDAOLogicV2.sol#L952

## [G&#x2011;06]  State variables should be cached in stack variables rather than re-reading them from storage
The instances below point to the second+ access of a state variable within a function. Caching of a state variable replace each Gwarmaccess (**100 gas**) with a much cheaper stack read. Other less obvious fixes/optimizations include having local memory caches of state variable structs, or having local caches of state variable contracts/addresses.

*There are 11 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;07]  Multiple accesses of a mapping/array should use a local variable cache
The instances below point to the second+ access of a value inside a mapping/array, within a function. Caching a mapping's value in a local `storage` or `calldata` variable when the value is accessed [multiple times](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ec23a57daa30a8f8ca8b9681c8ccefb0), saves **~42 gas per access** due to not having to recalculate the key's keccak256 hash (Gkeccak256 - **30 gas**) and that calculation's associated stack operations. Caching an array's struct avoids recalculating the array offsets into memory/calldata

*There are 2 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;08]  `internal` functions only called once can be inlined to save gas
Not inlining costs **20 to 40 gas** because of two extra `JUMP` instructions and additional stack operations needed for function calls.

*There are 7 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;09]  Add `unchecked {}` for subtractions where the operands cannot underflow because of a previous `require()` or `if`-statement
`require(a <= b); x = b - a` => `require(a <= b); unchecked { x = b - a }`

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/base/ERC721Checkpointable.sol

/// @audit require() on line 278
279:          return a - b;

```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-nounsdao/blob/45411325ec14c6d747b999a40367d3c5109b5a89/contracts/base/ERC721Checkpointable.sol#L279

## [G&#x2011;10]  `<array>.length` should not be looked up in every loop of a `for`-loop
The overheads outlined below are _PER LOOP_, excluding the first loop
* storage arrays incur a Gwarmaccess (**100 gas**)
* memory arrays use `MLOAD` (**3 gas**)
* calldata arrays use `CALLDATALOAD` (**3 gas**)

Caching the length changes each of these to a `DUP<N>` (**3 gas**), and gets rid of the extra `DUP<N>` needed to store the stack offset

*There are 8 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;11]  `++i`/`i++` should be `unchecked{++i}`/`unchecked{i++}` when it is not possible for them to overflow, as is the case when used in `for`- and `while`-loops
The `unchecked` keyword is new in solidity version 0.8.0, so this only applies to that version or higher, which these instances are. This saves **30-40 gas [per loop](https://gist.github.com/hrkrshnn/ee8fabd532058307229d65dcd5836ddc#the-increment-in-for-loop-post-condition-can-be-made-unchecked)**

*There are 8 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;12]  `require()`/`revert()` strings longer than 32 bytes cost extra gas
Each extra memory word of bytes past the original 32 [incurs an MSTORE](https://gist.github.com/hrkrshnn/ee8fabd532058307229d65dcd5836ddc#consider-having-short-revert-strings) which costs **3 gas**

*There are 86 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;13]  Optimize names to save gas
`public`/`external` function names and `public` member variable names can be optimized to save gas. See [this](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/a5d8b486a8259f9f77891a919febd1a9) link for an example of how it works. Below are the interfaces/abstract contracts that can be optimized so that the most frequently-called functions use the least amount of gas possible during method lookup. Method IDs that have two leading zero bytes can save **128 gas** each during deployment, and renaming functions to have lower method IDs will save **22 gas** per call, [per sorted position shifted](https://medium.com/joyso/solidity-how-does-function-name-affect-gas-consumption-in-smart-contract-47d270d8ac92)

*There are 5 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;14]  Use a more recent version of solidity
Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.2 to get simple compiler automatic inlining
Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.3 to get better struct packing and cheaper multiple storage reads
Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.4 to get custom errors, which are cheaper at deployment than `revert()/require()` strings
Use a solidity version of at least 0.8.10 to have external calls skip contract existence checks if the external call has a return value

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/base/ERC721Enumerable.sol

28:   pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-nounsdao/blob/45411325ec14c6d747b999a40367d3c5109b5a89/contracts/base/ERC721Enumerable.sol#L28

## [G&#x2011;15]  `++i` costs less gas than `i++`, especially when it's used in `for`-loops (`--i`/`i--` too)
Saves **5 gas per loop**

*There are 10 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;16]  Splitting `require()` statements that use `&&` saves gas
See [this issue](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-01-xdefi-findings/issues/128) which describes the fact that there is a larger deployment gas cost, but with enough runtime calls, the change ends up being cheaper by **3 gas**

*There are 19 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;17]  Usage of `uints`/`ints` smaller than 32 bytes (256 bits) incurs overhead
> When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contractâ€™s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.11/internals/layout_in_storage.html
Each operation involving a `uint8` costs an extra [**22-28 gas**](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/9388d20c70f9a4632eb3ca7836f54977) (depending on whether the other operand is also a variable of type `uint8`) as compared to ones involving `uint256`, due to the compiler having to clear the higher bits of the memory word before operating on the `uint8`, as well as the associated stack operations of doing so. Use a larger size then downcast where needed

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/base/ERC721Checkpointable.sol

/// @audit uint32 upper
191:                  upper = center - 1;

```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-nounsdao/blob/45411325ec14c6d747b999a40367d3c5109b5a89/contracts/base/ERC721Checkpointable.sol#L191

## [G&#x2011;18]  Using `private` rather than `public` for constants, saves gas
If needed, the values can be read from the verified contract source code, or if there are multiple values there can be a single getter function that [returns a tuple](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-frax/blob/90f55a9ce4e25bceed3a74290b854341d8de6afa/src/contracts/FraxlendPair.sol#L156-L178) of the values of all currently-public constants. Saves **3406-3606 gas** in deployment gas due to the compiler not having to create non-payable getter functions for deployment calldata, not having to store the bytes of the value outside of where it's used, and not adding another entry to the method ID table

*There are 31 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;19]  Don't compare boolean expressions to boolean literals
`if (<x> == true)` => `if (<x>)`, `if (<x> == false)` => `if (!<x>)`

*There are 2 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;20]  Division by two should use bit shifting
`<x> / 2` is the same as `<x> >> 1`. While the compiler uses the `SHR` opcode to accomplish both, the version that uses division incurs an overhead of [**20 gas**](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ec0e4e6c4f52a6bca158f137a3afd4ff) due to `JUMP`s to and from a compiler utility function that introduces checks which can be avoided by using `unchecked {}` around the division by two

*There are 2 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;21]  `require()` or `revert()` statements that check input arguments should be at the top of the function
Checks that involve constants should come before checks that involve state variables, function calls, and calculations. By doing these checks first, the function is able to revert before wasting a Gcoldsload (**2100 gas***) in a function that may ultimately revert in the unhappy case.

*There are 3 instances of this issue.*

## [G&#x2011;22]  Empty blocks should be removed or emit something 
The code should be refactored such that they no longer exist, or the block should do something useful, such as emitting an event or reverting. If the contract is meant to be extended, the contract should be `abstract` and the function signatures be added without any default implementation. If the block is an empty `if`-statement block to avoid doing subsequent checks in the else-if/else conditions, the else-if/else conditions should be nested under the negation of the if-statement, because they involve different classes of checks, which may lead to the introduction of errors when the code is later modified (`if(x){}else if(y){...}else{...}` => `if(!x){if(y){...}else{...}}`). Empty `receive()`/`fallback() payable` functions that are not used, can be removed to save deployment gas.

*There is 1 instance of this issue:*
```solidity
File: contracts/governance/NounsDAOLogicV2.sol

1030:     receive() external payable {}

```
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-nounsdao/blob/45411325ec14c6d747b999a40367d3c5109b5a89/contracts/governance/NounsDAOLogicV2.sol#L1030

## [G&#x2011;23]  Use custom errors rather than `revert()`/`require()` strings to save gas
Custom errors are available from solidity version 0.8.4. Custom errors save [**~50 gas**](https://gist.github.com/IllIllI000/ad1bd0d29a0101b25e57c293b4b0c746) each time they're hit by [avoiding having to allocate and store the revert string](https://blog.soliditylang.org/2021/04/21/custom-errors/#errors-in-depth). Not defining the strings also save deployment gas
